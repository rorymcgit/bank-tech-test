# Bank - Tech Test

I decided to solve this problem in Ruby, as the solution requires a back-end CLI interface.

```
As an account-holder,  
So I can add to my account,  
I want to deposit an amount of money.  

As an account-holder,  
So I can use money in my account,  
I want to withdraw an amount of money.  

As an account-holder,  
So I have visibility over my bank account status and history,  
I want to see my account statement with date, credit/debit and running balance.  


As a bank manager,  
So the bank can make money,  
I want to charge people if they go overdrawn.  

```
